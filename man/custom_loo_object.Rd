\title{Builds a loo object that contains any pointwise criterion, acting as elpd
for compatibility.}
\usage{
custom_loo_object(pointwise_criterion, psis_object = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{pointwise_criterion}{vector of criterion values for each observation}

\item{psis_object}{\code{brms:::.psis} object for psis diagnostics}
}
\value{
a loo object, containing a criterion, disguised as elpd

\description{
LOO currently has hardcoded expectations of elpd as part of loo objects
so to use loo objects, we have to disguise other criterions as elpd.
