\title{Quantifies deviation from uniformity by the likelihood of observing the
most extreme point on the empirical CDF of the given rank distribution
according to \link{1} (equation 7).}
\usage{
gamma_discrepancy(ranks, post_warmup_draws, log = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{ranks}{Rank distribution}

\item{post_warmup_draws}{Number of posterior draws that were used to
calculate the rank distribution.}

\item{log}{True of the result should be on the log scale.}
}
\value{
Measure quantifying deviation from uniformity. This value can
be compared to the distribution of gamma expected under uniformity
calculated by validation.gamma_null_distribution.
